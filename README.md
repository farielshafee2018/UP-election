Uttar Pradesh (UP) is a state in India.  This project uses real data from UP elections and was assigned as a project by Think CLoudy.  The questions were in real life also used to solicit political data analysts by the Indian government.  

The point of the project is to understand voting patterns in different constituencies at three levels.  The project was initially formulated by the Bharatiya Janata party.  So we have tried to understand the main concerns and weaknesses of BJP and have come up with recommendations.

This project, thus, analyses data to understand election policies and suggest improvements.

Python was used as the main tool for analysis.

The data analysis is accompanied by notes and suggestions.  A separate file is uploaded with suggestions as well.
